# HTML-CSS-PROJECT

HTML/CSS Mini Project (University)
Dear members,
We are so delighted to see your progress and motivation to cross every hurdle coming your way.
Hereby we are excited to announce the commencement of our HTML/CSS Mini Project.

Project- based learning is a learning technique that focuses heavily on building real- world projects. Project-based learning, if done correctly, lets you get a feel of the basics through simple tutorials (preferably by reading the docs or watching YouTube) and then immediately building what you want once you gain enough understanding to start writing your own code. It gives you the freedom to learn as you create, so you'll master the art of scouring Stack Overflow for answers to problems. And you will use 100% of the stuff you learn because it will directly apply to a problem that you are trying to fix.



For the coming week, we are planning to work on a mini-project. Using HTML/CSS Mini Project. You have to pick up a topic and work on it for the next coming week.

Following are the 3 projects out of which you will choose from
